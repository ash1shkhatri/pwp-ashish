          <br>Despite his limitations, Ravi enjoys making friends and hanging out in the afternoon. His other interests include watching movies,

        <BR>  Ravi lives with his parents, dealing with epilepsy and needing frequent rest due to medications. In his waking moments, he enjoys playing phone games, watching YouTube videos, and talking to his siblings. Seeing the world with the simplicity of a nine-year-old, Ravi openly expresses his feelings,
        oblivious to social nuances.
        The greetings and brief chats from neighbors and relatives bring him immense joy, adding warmth to his daily life.

        <p>  <br>  <b> Frustrations and Needs:</b> </p>
        <br> Ravi encounters considerable challenges in making friends and forming connections due to his intellectual disability.
        His difficulty in conversing like an adult often results in a lack of attention, making it challenging for him to enjoy the
        simple pleasure of hanging out with friends. This frustration arises from a fundamental need to socialize and share stories,
        a desire shared by every human being. Unfortunately, societal stigma towards disabled individuals in Nepal intensifies these
        challenges, making it arduous for Ravi to find the companionship he seeks. Despite these hurdles, Ravi remains resilient,
        searching for a platform that
        not only recognizes his challenges but also offers an opportunity to connect with others who comprehend and value his unique journey.

        His vision involves utilizing the site to discover meetup groups, fostering in-person connections, and making friends beyond
        the digital realm. With a desire to extend his social circle and build lasting connections,
        Ravi looks to this platform as a stepping stone for creating genuine friendships and shared experiences outside
        of the online space.</p>
